=head1 NAME

C<MediaWords::DBI::Activities> - Package to log various activities (story
edits, media edits, etc.)

=head1 NOTES

=over 4

=item * It is advised to manually C<BEGIN TRANSACTION> before logging an
activity and C<COMMIT> after the logging is successful. C<__log_activity()>
doesn't initiate its own transaction in order to not disturb the transaction
that the caller of might have initiated.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head2 Logging a single activity

    $c->dbis->begin_work;

    # Snapshot the topic
    create_snapshot();

    # Log activity
    my $change = {
        'field' => 'description',
        'old_value' => $old_description,
        'new_value' => $new_description
    };
    unless (
        MediaWords::DBI::Activities::__log_activity(
            $c->dbis, 'tm_snapshot_topic', $c->user->username, $stories_id, $reason, $change
        )
      )
    {
        $c->dbis->rollback;
        die "Unable to log addition of new tags.\n";
    }

    $c->dbis->commit;

=head1 LIST OF ACTIVITIES

=head2 (static) C<%ACTIVITIES>

List of available activities that can be logged, their descriptions, pointers
to what the object ID refers to and parameters.

All activities that are logged *must* be added to this hash.

To add a new activity, add a sub-entry to this hash.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 (static) C<__log_activity($db, $activity_name, $user, $object_id, $reason, $description_hash)>

Log activity.

Parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<$db> - Reference to the database object.

=item * C<$activity_name> - Activity name from the C<%ACTIVITIES> hash, e.g.
C<tm_mine_topic>.

=item * C<$user> - User that initiated the activity, either: a) user's email,
e.g. C<jdoe@mediacloud.org>, or b) system username if the activity was
initiated from the shell and not from the web UI, e.g. C<system:jdoe>.

=item * C<$object_id> - integer ID of an object (e.g. story ID, media ID) that
was modified by the activity. Pass 0 if there's no objects to refer to.

=item * C<$reason> - Reason the activity was made. Pass empty string ('') if
there was no reason provided.

=item * C<$description_hash> - hashref of miscellaneous parameters that
describe the activity, e.g.:

    {
        'field' => 'description',   # Field that was edited
        'old_value' => 'Foo...',    # Old value of the field
        'new_value' => 'Bar!'       # New value of the field
    }

=back

Returns 1 if the activity was logged. Returns 0 on error.

=head2 (static) C<log_system_activity($db, $activity_name, $object_id, $description_hash)>

Log system activity (the one that was initiated on the shell and not from the
web UI).

See C<__log_activity()> for the description of other parameters of this
subroutine.

Returns 1 if the activity was logged. Returns 0 on error.

}

=head1 HELPERS

The helpers described below are mainly used by the web UI that lists the
activities from the database.

=head2 (static) C<__encode_activity_description($activity_name, $description_hash)>

Validates and encodes an activity description hash to a string value (JSON in
the current implementation).

Parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<$activity_name> - Activity name from the C<%ACTIVITIES> hash, e.g.
C<tm_mine_topic>.

=item * C<$description_hash> - hashref of miscellaneous parameters that
describe the activity.

=back

Returns a (JSON-encoded) string activity description.

C<die()>s on error.
