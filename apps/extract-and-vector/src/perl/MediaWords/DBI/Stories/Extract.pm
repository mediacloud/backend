=head2 get_all_sentences( $db, $story )

Parse sentences in story from the extracted text.  return in the form:

    { sentence => $sentence, ss => $matching_story_sentence, stories_id => $stories_id }

The list of returned sentences includes sentences that are deduped before storing story_sentences for each story. This
function is useful for comparing against the stored story_sentences.
