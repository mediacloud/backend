"""(Here and in extract-and-vector) Number of times this worker had to requeue a job.

Both of the extract_and_vector and fetch_link jobs have locking (of the media id for extract_and_vector and for the
web fetching domain locking for fetch_link). The locks in both cases are handled by a non-blocking query to postgres
(for extract_and_vector of an advisory lock, for fetch_link of the domain_requests table). It's easy for the jobs to
get into a tight loop of trying and failing to obtain the lock and in the process putting a lot of load onto
postgres (through the lock queries) and rabbitmq (through the job fetches and requeues).

So in both cases I keep count of how many times in a row the job has failed to get the lock and immediately requeued
the job. Once that count hits some limit, I start throttling by waiting a second between attempts. To my knowledge,
this has worked well. It is much more important for the fetch_link job, since that queue often consists entirely of
requests that are being throttled. If we remove this check, that fetch_link pool will often enter a tight loop of
postgres queries and requeues (or 64 tight loops!).

It is less important for the extract_and_vector jobs because it is not as common for that queue to be filled up with
jobs locked on a given media source. It does happen, though -- I added that non-blocking / requeueing code in the
first place because the extractor pool was sometimes getting all stuck waiting for a single media source.
