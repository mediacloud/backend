If this file exists, it means that a fresh data volume was just mounted to the
container, and the container is about to run for the first time ever, so
there's no point in attempting to check the schema version and apply
migrations.

After the first time this container gets run, this file will get deleted and
every subsequent run of the same container will then attempt to apply
migrations in order to upgrade the schema before continuing with anything else.
