On May 25th, it was time for a <a href=\"http://www.softwarelivre.org/news/13553\" target=\"_blank\">demonstration</a> in Porto Alegre. On June 1st, a similar protest happened in Minas Gerais and a <a href=\"http://twitter.com/mega_nao/status/2092707194\">new one is being planned</a> now in Rio de Janeiro.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">These protests have been called “Against the Digital AI-5” after the Brazilian dictatorship&#39;s Institutional Act Number Five or “<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI-5\">AI-5</a>&#8220;, the fifth, and considered the most cruel, of seventeen decrees issued by the military dictatorship in the years following the 1964 coup d&#39;état in Brazil. Issued in 1968, AI-5 abolished freedom of expression by introducing the preliminary censorship of music, films, theater and television. Any work considered subversive to the political and moral values of the country was censored and artists jailed. AI-5 marked the transition to the toughest period  of human rights violations in Brazilian history.</p>\n<p>All over Brazil, mobilization against the proposed bill has been organized by a group of bloggers, who have put together a manifesto, a <a href=\"http://twitter.com/mega_nao\">Twitter account</a> and <a href=\"http://meganao.wordpress.com/\">Mega Não!</a> [Mega No!, pt], a blog created with the single purpose of gathering information and contributing to clarify what this bill might mean for Internet users in the country:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A proposta do Mega Não, é ser um meta manifesto, um agregador de informações e de diversas manifestações na Internet e fora dela, com o objetivo de combater o vigilantismo. Diversos núcleos ciberativistas estão surgindo e aumentando o discurso e a pressão popular contra o vigilantismo, tenta agregar, fomentar e ajudar a divulgar estes eventos é a nossa proposta, nos informe de seus movimentos, vamos juntar forças!!!</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"translation\">Mega Não&#39;s aim is to be a meta manifesto, a place to gather information about the various protests on the Internet and outside it, with the aim to fight surveillance. Many cyberactivist groups are emerging and increasing both the discussion of and popular pressure against vigilantism. To try to aggregate, foster and help promote those demonstrations is our main goal. Tell us about your demonstrations, let&#39;s join forces together!</div>\n<p>An <a href=\"http://www.petitiononline.com/veto2008/\">online petition</a> against the Digital Crimes Bill released back in 2008 has already gathered 146,627 signatures. Users of Orkut, one of the most popular online social networks in Brazil, have also entered this fight, since many of the demands of this bill are related to this specific social network. One of many related communities, &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.orkut.com.br/Main#Community.aspx?cmm=59842273\">Não ao projeto de Azeredo</a>&#8221; [No to the Azeredo Bill, pt], has already attracted 6,563 members.</p>\n<p>Activists are also using Twitter as an informative tool for their meetings and collaborative blogging about the subject: the hashtags <a href=\"http://search.twitter.com/search?q=meganao\">#meganao</a> and <a href=\"http://search.twitter.com/search?q=ai5digital\">#ai5digital</a> are usually used by bloggers and tweeters and represent a source of information for those seeking updates on how to contribute to the campaign. In addition to this, many of the demonstrations&#39; organizers, supporters and enthusiasts can also be found on Twitter, such as <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/caribe\">@caribe</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/pauloteixeira13\">@pauloteixeira13</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/samadeu\">@samadeu</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/arlesophia\">@arlesophia</a> and <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/myris\">@myris</a>.

For many Brazilian bloggers and Internet users, it looks like the media outlets, in addition to Internet companies and the government, are willing to see the bill approved, so that they will have control over what people say and do all over the Web. Antonio Arles (<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/arlesophia\">@arlesophia</a>) comments on this in his <a href=\"http://www.arlesophia.com.br/?p=545\">blog</a> [pt] and stresses how the Internet is useful to gather information about the demonstrations:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Participei (presencialmente ou via Internet) de pelo menos três atos este ano em que a Rede foi importante para a organização, difusão e transmissão: o Ato contra a “Ditabranda” da Folha, o Saia Gilmar e o Ato Contra o AI-5 Digital. E é justamente essa possibilidade de exercício da cidadania um dos motivos da adesão dos oligopólios midiáticos ao AI-5 Digital. A lógica é a mesma da dos órgãos de repressão do Império Soviético ou da Ditadura Civil-Militar Brasileira. Apesar de usaram a máscara de “democratas” - usando argumentos como o da liberdade quando seus interesses estão em jogo, tentando confundir “liberdade de imprensa” com “liberdade da empresa” -, os oligopólios midiáticos são fruto de uma ditadura. Em última análise, são uma das faces da Ditadura Civil-Militar que continuam vivas depois da redemocratização. A questão é que, para além dos interesses econômicos, a tentativa de criminalização e de aprofundar vigilantismo na Internet é uma tentativa de manutenção do monopólio da informação/opinião e, conseqüentemente, do poder.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"translation\">I have participated (in person or online) in at least three demonstrations this year for which the Internet was an important organizational, promotional and broadcasting tool: the action against the &#8220;<a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/03/07/brazil-uproar-over-newpapers-editorial-on-mild-dictatorship/\">Ditabranda</a>&#8221; editorial of Folha de São Paulo newspaper, the Fora Gilmar [a protest calling for Chief Justice  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilmar_Mendes\">Gilmar Mendes</a> to leave Brazil&#39;s Supreme Court] and the action against the Digital AI-5. And this possibility of exercising our citizenship is actually one of the reasons for the mass media&#39;s support of the Digital AI-5. The logic is the same as those of the suppression apparatus of the Soviet Empire or Brazilian Dictatorship. Although they wear the masks of democrats - arguing about freedom when actually their interests are at stake, and trying to confuse &#8220;press freedom&#8221; with &#8220;company freedom&#8221; - the mass media companies are a child of the dictatorship. In the last case, they are the faces of the civic-military dictatorship that live on after the re-democratization. The point is: beyond their economic interests, the attempt to criminalize and deepen vigilantism on the Web is actually an attempt to keep the monopoly of information/opinion and, consequently, of power.</div>\n<div id=\"attachment_79261\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 407px\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/pontodeak/3546813520/\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-79261\" title=\"Mega No!\" src=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/3546813520_bab2b706db.jpg\" alt=\"&quot;No, Azeredo&quot;, in São Paulo.

      "description" : "<p>Homosexuality is perceived as a new phenomenon in Africa and a taboo. It is outlawed in many African countries. Many African leaders have condemned homosexuality as being un-African. The Zimbabwean President, Robert Mugabe once described<a href=\"http://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/powell41.13819.html\"> gays as worse than dogs and pigs</a>. Former Namibia&#39;s President, Sam Nujoma, <a href=\"http://www.iglhrc.org/cgi-bin/iowa/article/takeaction/resourcecenter/88.html\">once stated that</a> &#8220;Homosexuals must be condemned and rejected in our society.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Nigeria introduced a bill in 2007 banning same sex marriage. <a href=\"http://rodonline.typepad.com/rodonline/2007/01/nigeria_prepare.html\">According to Rod 2.0</a> the bill is the most comprehensive homophobic legislation ever proposed in the world. Early this year homosexuals in Nigeria <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200903120143.html\">stormed the National Assembly </a>seeking for legislation that will guarantee the protection. </p>\n<p>Lifestyle, culture and religion have become the invisible fence to many homosexuals in Africa barring them from their freedom of sexual expression. A Kenyan blogger, <a href=\"http://wildeyearnings.blogspot.com/\">Wilde Yearnings</a>, <a href=\"http://wildeyearnings.blogspot.com/2009/06/colour-me-impressed.html\">was quite optimistic </a>after US President Barack Obama officially declared June being a gay pride month and decriminalizing of homosexuality all over the world earlier this month. He posted Obama&#39;s speech on his blog:</p>\n<blockquote><p>My Administration has partnered with the LGBT community to advance a wide range of initiatives. At the international level, I have joined efforts at the United Nations to decriminalize homosexuality around the world&#8230;NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2009 as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month. I call upon the people of the United States to turn back discrimination and prejudice everywhere it exists.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://queeryoung.blogspot.com/\">Naughy Feeling</a> <a href=\"http://wildeyearnings.blogspot.com/2009/06/colour-me-impressed.html?showComment=1243962067469#c8734662213807852226\">commented on the post</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is great our comrades in America are getting recognition. In our dear country we can&#39;t stick our necks in the sand and tell ourselves all will be well. The gigantous task ahead demands of us that we kid not ourselves of the responsibility ahead of us. It may require sacrifices but all for the greater good. May God bless LGBT kenya n give us strength for what is ahead. But hey, look on the bright side, we can still have fun at it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But will culture, religion and lifestyle factors derail the decriminalisation of homosexuality in most African countries or will it be as Wilde Yearnings described &#8220;meanwhile in Kenya&#8230; The struggle continues&#8230;&#8221;?</p>\n<p>It has been said that homosexuality is a lifestyle  adapted by Africans from the West, <a href=\"http://http://afrogay.blogspot.com/\">SebaSpace</a> a Ugandan blogger <a href=\"http://http://afrogay.blogspot.com/2009/06/gay-lifestyle-versus-being-gay-what-is.html\">tries to points out that his &#8220;sexuality&#8221;  and &#8220;him &#8221; are one,</a> that homosexuality cannot be a lifestyle because for him to be involved with someone it has to be sexually, emotionally and spiritually bringing the fact that homosexuality is a physiological function too.  </p>\n<p>SebaSpace has been on a constant war with an anti-gay blogger also from Uganda and the war is always revolving around religion, culture and lifestyle. This created a stir in the LGBT blogosphere and another<a href=\"http://kenyangay.blogspot.com/\"> gay Kenyan blogger </a> wrotes a post<a href=\"http://kenyangay.blogspot.com/2009/05/response-to-rep-pepper.html \"> to answer the three questions </a><a href=\"http://www.redpepper.ug/\">The Red Pepper</a> had asked. The questions were:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1. If you try to drink water through the ear, you naturally spoil it because it was created by God to do the hearing function. That&#39;s physical harm.</p>\n<p>2. when they discovered you were gay. You know very well how we love having grandchildren in Africa. Imagine what goes on in your parents&#39; minds to know that you will never give them grandchildren (I am assuming that you a die-hard gay man but if you are bi, please forgive me). So that is emotional harm.</p>\n<p>3. Spiritual harm. You tamper with God&#39;s plan of procreation. Understand that the main reason of creating the sexual organs was procreation purposes. For you in an attempt to be very creative, you put your organs at the disposal of pleasure only (I hope it is fun).If you have radical parents, they can start questioning God as to why he gave them such a child. I know parents of a gay boy who visited scores of witchdoctors thinking that their child had been bewitched. I can give you as many reasons as possible. I hope you are an objective gentleman who looks at things objectively.<br />\nWith so much hate from all sides, will the African Leaders put their priorities in order from all the pressure by the UN, IMF and World Bank and speak out for the sexual minorities or will still hold them in this invisible cage?\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://kenyangay.blogspot.com/2009/05/response-to-rep-pepper.html\">His answers</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Ugandan rag called Red Pepper has been engaging Afro gay, a fellow Gay blogger from Uganda in arguments regarding the situation on Homosexuality in Uganda. Follow this link to see the full post. Recently, the editor of red pepper wrote to Afro arguing that he (Afro) was causing Physical, emotional and Spiritual harm to his family by being gay.</p>\n<p>I promised Afro that I will write my responses to the Editor on my blog and link back with him. I have taken their questions, edited without altering the message and I have responded to each question.</p>\n<p>I tend to disagree with you when you say that homos have never done anybody physical, emotional or spiritual harm.</p>\n<p>Without any prejudice I want to tell you that they are guilty of all the three accounts.</p>\n<p>Count 1. If you try to drink water through the ear, you naturally spoil it because it was created by God to do the hearing function. That&#39;s physical harm.</p>\n<p>Red pepper has made three elementary mistakes (assumptions) 1) The common one that homosexuality is equal to sodomy (their shallow analogy of the ear above) 2) Following number 1 above that sodomy is practiced only by homosexuals and 3) That all homosexuals engage in anal sex.</p>\n<p>I will deal with the last one first. Is the paper saying they are ok with someone with homosexual orientation as long as they don’t engage in sex? Have they ever heard of celibate gay people and gay people who don’t engage in anal sex? Well, I have and know both types.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s worth noting, that from the very beginning sodomy and homosexuality were two categorically separate things. The correct definition of sodomy&#8211;then and now&#8211;is simply non-procreative sex, whether practiced by heterosexuals or homosexuals. It includes oral sex, masturbation, mutual masturbation, contraceptive sex, coitus interruptus, and anal sex&#8211;any sex in which semen does not find its way into a uterus.</p>\n<p>The anal sex thing is one elephant in the room, but it&#39;s not an inherent part of being gay, it isn&#39;t an activity engaged in exclusively by gay people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>SebaSpace <a href=\"http://afrogay.blogspot.com/2009/05/questions-questions-red-pepper-persists.html\">refused to answer the questions</a> from Red Pepper. He gives reasons for his refusal: </p>\n<blockquote><p>If you look at the e-mail below, the editor of the Red Pepper has valid questions he is asking and, ordinarily, I would answer them – indeed I have answered these questions over the years more times than I have had hot dinners.</p>\n<p>The problem for me now is I don’t believe the people asking the questions are sincere. Rightly or wrongly, I think all they are looking for is material to feed their tabloid frenzy and so I have refused to provide the answers. That said, I think it would be okay for other bloggers to attempt to answer them on their blogs or wherever as they are legitimate.</p>\n<p>Here is the e-mail I got from the Red Pepper and the questions they posed [heavily emended for clarity]</p>\n<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>\n<p>Well, you have not answered Phiona&#39;s question and I am sure she will maintain her opinion. I also have a feeling that you don&#39;t have an answer for it. The times I have interacted with you I have discovered that you are a clever man who cannot answer a question unless you are sure the answer is convincing.Again I tend to disagree with you when you say that homos have never done anybody physical, emotional or spiritual harm.<br />\nWithout any prejudice I want to tell you that they are guilty of all the three accounts.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>While gay and lesbian bloggers in Africa use blogs to express themselves freely, there are also anti gay bloggers targeting them. One of them, Blake, had a blog called Kenyans Against Gays before it was suspended for violating Blogger&#39;s Terms of Service. <a href=\"http://kenyangay.blogspot.com/2009/02/anti-gay-blog-suspended.html\">Kenyan  Gay wrote about the suspension</a>: </p>\n<blockquote><p>A couple of years ago, a dude called Blake started this blog and I think the first thing he did was to announce its launch on my blog. Over time, that blog grew with articles explaining why he felt he should take a position against us etc.</p>\n<p>However, from propagating his position against homosexuality in recent times he moved to actually calling for gay people in Kenya to be killed. I have been alerted by a reader that the blog has been suspended whilst being investigated for possible blogger rules violation. I suspect it is because of his latest position that was quite militant.</p>\n<p>I am a believer in freedom of expression and actually think that blog helped expose that there are some willing to propagate hate to get their point across. But I draw the line when someone advocates for homosexuals to be killed.</p>\n<p>I think his blog served us more than it aimed to destroy us. This is because we have many Kenyan gay blogs and Blake used to visit all of them and in the comments section try to drive traffic to his site. If you followed links, you would find that very many of the comments were from people who attempted to engage him intellectually on gay issues. Unfortunately, there were those usual vile comments from both sides with most insults coming from him. He was a troll on my blog until I decided to ignore him.</p></blockquote>\n<p>When you visit Kenyans Against Gays blog <a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/blogin.g?blogspotURL=http%3A%2F%2Fkenyansagainstgays.blogspot.com%2F\">you get the following message</a>: </p>\n<blockquote><p>\nThis blog is in violation of Blogger&#39;s Terms of Service and is open to authors only</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, Blake went on to start<a href=\"http://www. kenyansagainstgays.wordpress.com/\"> another blog</a> using Wordpress. </p>\n",

      "description" : "<p>Chinese information activists have been testing and collecting information about the government sponsored filter software, &#8220;Green Dam Youth Escort&#8221; via blog posts, twitter (search <a href=http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23greendam>#greendam</a>) and collaborative platforms since the <a href=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124440211524192081.html>WSJ&#39;s news about Beijing government required PC makers to install filter software for all the PCs shipped to China from July 1 2009 onward</a> popped up. Some of them collectively put together a technical analysis of the software at <a href=https://docs.google.com/Edit?docid=afk7vnz54wt_12f8jzj9gw>google document</a> and the result shows that the filter is full of flaws:</p>\n<p><strong>Collaborative Testing: a leaking dam</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>Current versions only support Windows; effective only when used in conjunction with Internet Explorer or Google Chrome, it has no effect when used with Firefox. The harmful information screened by the software includes politically-related harmful information, and the software relies on non-conventional methods to install, also ineffective within Firefox, closing the browser and adding the website address onto a banned list without confirmation. In Internet Explorer, the software&#39;s ability to classify clearly political content as &#8220;harmful information&#8221; is unreliable; for pornographic content, Green Dam is able to make relatively accurate assessments. When used with Firefox, however, the software shows no response.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Deep blue sea</em>, upon testing the program, <a href=http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_4978eb400100do6j.html>asked</a>:</p>\n<p><blockqutoe>如果用户在使用过程中由于兼容问题出现了影响正常功能使用，或出现了网络隐私泄密，网络银行被盗，等等重大损失，请问工信部负责赔偿吗!</p>\n<p>从上述测试来看，此软件对系统资源的占用是巨大的，会严重影响到一些用户的正常使用。会另一些不熟悉电脑网络设置的人群深受其害。</p>\n<div class=\"translation\">If the program clashes with other programs and affects the computer&#39;s other function, or if the network was hacked and user&#39;s private information, such as bank password got stolen, will the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) be ready to pay for the loss?</p>\n<p>From the above test result, the software would occupy much computer resources and affect other programs, junior computer users will suffer. </p></div>\n<p><strong>Over blocking</strong></p>\n<p>ESWN translated some teacher&#39;s <a href=http://www.zonaeuropa.com/200906a.brief.htm#017>comments on the filter software from KDnet</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>- I don&#39;t want to discuss whether the functionalities of Green Dam are good or bad, but it is a nuisance because of all the upgrading that goes on.  We are a rural school, and we are using rural distance learning equipment (namely, Lenovo computers).  If we install Green Dam, then we cannot do simultaneous network broadcasts or hard disk protection.  Even if Green Dam guarantees safe Internet usage, how are we to maintain the software on our computers?  Our computer instructor is going to sit around all day to watch Green Dam being upgraded one computer at a time.  I am going to faint!  Our supervisory leaders must not know how to use computers!</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>- Let me say something here.  We were ordered to install the software.  So I have to come to this website and curse.  After we installed the software, many normal websites are banned.  For example, it is normal for students to like games such as 4399, but not any more &#8230; many news reports have certain normal words but they are banned &#8230; for example, when <network News> reports that there is a campaign against pornographic websites, the software bans the story because the term &#8220;pornographic websites&#8221; was used.  Don&#39;t tell me how great the software technology is, because this is a piece of junk.  When we need to look up some course-related material, there is always some provocative advertisements on the pages so we can&#39;t access them anymore.  Why doesn&#39;t the state just ban those advertisements directly?  I want to curse someone out &#8230;</network></p></blockquote>\n<p>As the keyword filter list includes words such as &#8220;touch&#8221; and &#8220;play&#8221; and the graphic detection is set to identify the proportion of skin color in a picture, funny results come out (also from ESWN&#39;s post):</p>\n<blockquote><p>- Can I determine the content of the text filtering?  Today, a teacher posted an exam question which talks about &#8220;students playing touch-ball game.&#8221;  The Word document was shut down.  I spent a long time trying to determine the cause.  This was really depressing.  It will be a lot of work dealing these kinds of things in the future.</p>\n<p>- How much flesh color does it take to make something &#8220;pornography&#8221;?  I went on the Internet to check out some animal photos.  A lovely little naked pig was sent onto the black list.  Pitiful little pig!  I was curious, so I looked up some photos of naked African women.  Oh, they were not censored!</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong><br />\nAll LGBT content banned</strong></p>\n<p><a href=http://jzyg163.blog.sohu.com/118225265.html>Jzyg found out</a> that all LGBT contents are banned :</p>\n<blockquote><p>一款绿色的流氓软件，把同性恋和色情，暴力等同，安装后默选项将会自动屏蔽所有包含有同性恋内容的网站，经测试国内知名的同性恋网站,如爱白、淡蓝、夫夫网等安装该软件后均会导致无法正常访问。测试还发现，只要网页中含有同性恋、gay、lesbian等与同性恋有关的词汇及经软件自动判别图片中“肉色 ”过多，和两个同性亲昵的动作出现后，网站即被屏蔽，无法正常显示。被屏蔽后，网站被自动列入软件黑名单内，该台电脑将无法再次打开此网站。</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"translation\">The software is a scumbag equalizes homosexuality with obscenity and violence. Once it is installed, it would filter away all websites with homosexual content. Upon testing, all famous LGBT websites, such as <a href=http://www.aibai.cn>Aibai</a>, <a href=http://www.idanlan.com>idanian</a>, <a href=http://www.aifufu.com>aifufu</a> and etc would be inaccessible. We also found out that if the websites contain keywords such as homosexual, gay, lesbian, the software would automatically identify the graphics as having too many &#8220;skin color&#8221; and same sex intimacy. The websites would then be blocked, compiled in the black list and banned from future visit. </div>\n<p><strong>Government budget and procedural justice</strong></p>\n<p>Given all its flaws and not so reliable filter result, the question followed is why the MIIT would spend more than 41 million yuans to pay the software company, Jinhui Technologies, one year license fee? </p>\n<p>The company&#39;s software promotion picture (below) seems to celebrate the fact that &#8220;Green Dam&#8221; is uphold by the government and taxpayer&#39;s money (represented by the two hands):</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/greendam-300x231.jpg\" alt=\"greendam\" title=\"greendam\" width=\"300\" height=\"231\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-79282\" /></p>\n<p>Indeed, the project is in partnership with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Finance and State Council Information Department. However, many people questioned the lack of consultation and monitoring of such partnership. A commentary written by Wang Lin, a law professor, in <a href=http://news.ifeng.com/opinion/politics/200906/0610_6438_1196065.shtml>ifeng pointed out</a> that:</p>\n<blockquote><p>工信部如此大手笔撒钱是否合乎政府财政支出的程序正义？从报道中可知，所谓供“全社会免费使用”，实则也是纳税人自己埋单，因为工信部等几部委使用中央财政资金4170万元人民币买断这套软件的一年服务。照工信部推行“绿坝-花季护航”的决心，应该不会只用一年就撤退，下一年度是否还要花费数以千万计的巨额资金购买软件服务？这样的大手笔，是否需要列入政府预算，接受人大代表的审议？</p>\n<p>这种以行政强制来推行的软件捆绑，还需接受《反垄断法》的拷问。</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"translation\">It is questionable whether the spending of the MIIT follows the principle of procedural justice. According to the report, even though it appears that the software is free, the cost is actually shouldered by the taxpayers as the MIIT and other departments will spend 41.7 million yuan for the one year license. As MIIT is very determined to continue the effort, the contract won&#39;t be ended after one year. Are we going to spend the huge amount of tax money on this in the future? Should such expense be properly budgeted and approved by people representatives?</p>\n<p>Moreover, we also need to check if the administrative promotion of this particular software has violated the current anti monopoly law. </p></div>\n<p><strong>Political concern</strong></p>\n<p>Apart from technical and procedural concern, fulue highlighted the software&#39;s <a href=http://fulue.com/2009/06/filter-dam.html>latent political implications</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>人们对政治层面的担忧就更多了，北京对互联网的管制是司马昭之心——路人皆知。除了秘密筑起臭名昭著的防火墙（GFW）外，更挂羊头卖狗肉，时不时借助一些运动进行整治。比如数月前刮起的那场声势浩大的“整顿互联网低俗之风”运动，运动过后中国的互联网依旧低俗，但是一些言辞尖锐的网站和博客却在运动中倒下。这就是北京理解的“低俗”！</p>\n<p>而现在，又要强制推广一个所谓的过滤色情网站的软件，而所过滤的内容又不提交独立的第三方审核，影响这么广泛的政策出台前又不经过社会的广泛讨论。不免令人质疑，在北京看来色情是否也包括政治呢？或许在北京的眼里的，政治色情比肉体色情更可怕。</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"translation\">People are more worried about its political implications. Beijing&#39;s control over the Internet is so obvious that everyone knows about its intension. Apart from building up the notorious Great Fire Wall in secret, it frequently launches campaign to clean up the Internet. A most well known example is the anti-vulgarity campaign. After the campaign, the Internet is still full of vulgar content, but a number of critical websites and bloggers have disappeared. It reflects Beijing&#39;s understanding of &#8220;vulgarity&#8221;. </p>\n<p>Now it promotes via regulation a so-called pornography filter software. However, there isn&#39;t any independent third party to monitor the filtered content. And there isn&#39;t any discussion in the society about the policy. People would of course doubt if the Beijing&#39;s definition of pornography would include politics. It is likely that Beijing regards political pornography more damaging than bodily pornography. </p></div>\n<p>Other related articles:</p>\n<p>Rebecca MacKinnon - <a href=http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/2009/06/chinas-green-dam-youth-escort-software.html>China&#39;s &#8220;Green Dam Youth Escort&#8221; software</a>, <a href=http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/2009/06/original-government-document-ordering-green-dam-software-installation.html>Original government document ordering &#8220;Green Dam&#8221; software installation</a>, <a href=http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/2009/06/green-dam-filtering-software-scorned-by-many-chinese.html>Green Dam filtering software scorned by many Chinese</a>.<br />\nImagethief - <a href=http://news.imagethief.com/blogs/china/default.aspx>Why I&#39;m not in a tizzy over China&#39;s new Internet filtering software</a></p>\n<p></blockqutoe></p>\n",

      "description" : "<p>News coming out of Pyongyang is not encouraging. After being accused of illegally crossing the border to North Korea, American Current TV journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee have been <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/06/08/nkorea.journalists/index.html\">sentenced</a> to 12 years of hard labor (according to CNN).  Jillian York <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/06/04/united-states-journalists-to-stand-trial-in-north-korea/?preview=true&amp;preview_id=78290&amp;preview_nonce=e6ca1b96c9\">rounded up blog posts</a> for Global Voices prior to the journalists&#39; sentencing.</p>\n<p>The bleak outcome is eliciting strong reactions online from those who support freedom of press and want North Korea to release the two journalists. A <a href=\"http:/www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=60755553149&amp;ref=ts\">Facebook page for Laura and Euna</a> already has more than five thousand members. Today they are asking the public to respect the families privacy at this moment and not to get emotional:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You will have many emotions racing. Please try to stay clear of anger. Anger is a waste of energy and what North Korea wants of you.We can and will work together and use our minds, to work this through.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://liberatelaura.wordpress.com/2009/06/08/something-rotten-in-pyongyang/\"><em>LiberateLaura</em></a>, a blog authored by Los Angeles entertainment journalist Richard Horgan, describes events happening in North Korea as &#8220;worthy of Shakespeare&#8221; and questions the decision of the &#8220;Hermit Kingdom&#8221; to arrest Laura Ling and Euna Lee:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Unfortunately, into that mad kingdom, just ahead of the chaos, wandered @Current journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee. On Tuesday, March 17th, whether by accident or the trickery of a paid-off Chinese guide, they are alleged to have stepped across an invisible border line at a bridge crossing between China and North Korea. Harsh interrogations and two and a half months of solitary confinement followed, and now, after a brief trial, an absurd sentence of 12 years of hard labor for illegally crossing the border and an unspecified “grave crime.”</p>\n<p>The Shakespearean analogy is useful because it allows us, just slightly, to make sense of the unfathomable June 8th Ling-Lee verdict. <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Kim Jong-il\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-il\">Kim Jong-il</a> is indeed pushing it to the limit on the diplomatic, nuclear and innocent Americans fronts, all in a bid to reassure the country’s military hard liners that a Kim Jong-un succession will maintain the Amy-first status quo.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>On <a href=\"http://youtube.com\">YouTube</a>, supporters are posting videos calling for the immediate release of Laura and Euna. There are also <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s7DPyxKDPI\">videos</a> and <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/90904665@N00/3593573407\">photos</a> of vigils in South Korea, San Fransisco and elsewhere in the United States.</p>\n<p>Here is as public service announcement from Pacific Rim Video and Kelly Hu:</p>\n<div><object width=\"408\" height=\"248\" data=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/rcakemWJ5FA&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/rcakemWJ5FA&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /></object></div>\n<p>As the public and various organizations promoting free press are coming together to call for Laura and Euna&#39;s release, some are now questioning the reactions of United States State Department and former U.S. vice president Al Gore (the founder and chairman of Current TV, which employed Euna and Laura) to the situation.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/KF06Dg01.html\">Asia Times</a>, Donald Kirk says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The North Koreans also get offended every time a top-level American visitor visits the region, and one immediate complication of the trial is that it coincides with a trip to South Korea, China and Japan of a US delegation led by Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg.</p>\n<p>Steinberg has not talked publicly about the two women but has made clear in meetings with South Korea&#39;s President Lee Myung-bak and other top officials that the US is not willing to negotiate their fate. Could he have had their case in mind when he assured Lee that the US would not offer more aid for North Korea. &#8220;</p></blockquote>\n<p>He then proceeds to speculate about Al Gore&#39;s involvement in negotiations:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;How about giving them up to a high-level American delegation? Gore comes to mind as the man for the job in view of his control over the network for which the two women were working.</p>\n<p>Gore has been strangely silent throughout, all the more reason to think he&#39;s waiting to give face to the North Koreans and rescue the two women - a happy ending that may be too much to hope for.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gore would be perfect for the mission. His presence would acknowledge North Korea&#39;s need for recognition as a member of the global nuclear club but would not constitute official US recognition of anything.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Not everyone is taking Gore&#39;s silence so lightly.  <em>John in Condition Yellow</em> takes Gore&#39;s lack of involvement less lightly, <a href=\"http://johninconditionyellow.blogspot.com/2009/06/wheres-al-gore.html\">saying</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I don&#39;t expect Mr. Global Warming to just drop what he&#39;s doing and go sailing off to north Korea to negotiate the release of two people who work for him. The Nobel Peace Prize winner is far too busy saving the planet. Right? But how long would it take for him to issue a simple statement like, &#8220;Hey, Kim Jomg Il! Let my people go, or we will take your carbon credits away.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But seriously, am I the only one who thinks that even a simple public statement from Mr. Pulitzer, condemning the trial, would at least be the decent thing to do for people who work for him?</p>\n<p>Hmmm. Okay, maybe Bill Richardson would be more effective.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But one thing is for certain, as <em>Jo </em><a href=\"http://jodiana.wordpress.com/2009/06/09/laura-ling-and-euna-lee-jailed-in-north-korea/\">points out</a> in the blog <em>Jo&#39;s Department</em> - everyone is wishing for the journalists&#39; safe return:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I hope that they do not endure Pyongyang’s horrific (as described by escapees) prison system and that two journalists could safely return and be reunited to their families soon.</p></blockquote>\n",

Some others suggested Casablanca. A website, <a id=\"qy-e\" title=\"President Obama to Speak in Morocco\" href=\"http://www.obamatospeakinmorocco.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>President Obama to Speak in Morocco</em></a>, was even set up for that purpose:</p>\n<blockquote><p>[We invite] President Obama to make Morocco the home for his first foreign policy speech abroad.<br />\nMorocco is the ideal country to launch a message of peace to the Muslim world.<br />\nA peace loving country with a respected voice in the region, Morocco is a long time friend of the United States and would be proud to host President Barack Obama in this historical event.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Eventually, and to the big disappointment of many Moroccan Obama enthusiasts, the American President did not speak in Morocco but preferred - logically, some would argue - Cairo, Egypt.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/05/28/morocco-the-blogmas-journey-continues/\" target=\"_blank\">The blogoma</a> (acronym for Moroccan blogosphere) and many Moroccan <em>Twitter</em> users reacted differently to the Cairo <a id=\"crcu\" title=\"speech\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/04/AR2009060401117.html\" target=\"_blank\">speech</a>.

Many are criticizing President Alan García and his government for their failure to enforce treaties and agreements that require the consultation with local communities before any action take place on their lands. This led to the protests and roadblocks in this region, and as a result of the police&#39;s attempt to clear the blockade, it produced the conflict in which indigenous community members and police were killed.</p>\n<p>There is also criticism of the way that the media is handling the situation, and opinions that many outlets are minimizing the deaths of the indigenous residents.</p>\n<p>Silvio Rendón of <em>Gran Combo Club [es]</em> writes about the neglect from the government to enforce the regulations outlined by the Free Trade Agreement with the United States and the International Labor Organization, <a href=\"http://grancomboclub.com/2009/06/%C2%BFla-revolucion-amazonica-de-2009.html\">which stipulates that there must be consultation with indigenous communities in regards to the use of their lands</a>.

Si el asunto arranca violando sus derechos, ¿por qué las comunidades tendrían que creer que la violación de sus derechos no va a seguir?</p>\n<p>El gobierno accedió al diálogo en medio de la protesta nativa, con los bloqueos ya en marcha. Sin embargo, de repente el gobierno decide que no va a hacer nada si la medida de fuerza continúa. Un repentino cambio de reglas. Y además, ¿qué puso sobre la mesa todo este tiempo? ¿Consulta a los nativos? No. Modificaciones cosméticas de las leyes rechazadas por los nativos. Entretanto, varios decretos han sido declarados inconstitucionales por la Defensoría del Pueblo como por la Comisión de Constitución del Congreso. No es que los nativos no tengan razón. El gobierno viene forcejeando por leyes que han sido declaradas inconstitucionales.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"translation\">\n<p>The issue is not about national or foreign investment, but that the rights of native communities are respected. If this continues to violate their rights, why should the communities believe that the violation of their rights will not continue?</p>\n<p>The government agreed to dialogue amid native protests with the roadblocks already underway. However, the government suddenly decides that it will not do anything if the measures continue. A sudden change of rules. And besides, what did it place on the table during this entire time? Do you consult the natives? No, only cosmetic modifications of the laws rejected by the natives. Meanwhile, several decrees have been declared unconstitutional by the Ombudsman and by Constitutional Committee of Congress. It is not that the natives are not right.  The government continues to force laws that have been declared unconstitutional.</p>\n</div>\n<p>In his blog <em>Conflictos Sociales en el Perú [es]</em>, Erick Garcia <a href=\"http://apuntesobreconflictos.blogspot.com/2009/06/desenlace-de-un-conflicto-la-muerte.html\">continues the criticism of the government for its role in this conflict</a> and its lack of prevention in this matter. Despite governmental intelligence and even common knowledge from reports from the media, it was well known that there were outside populations joining the protests:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ahora me pregunto si un par de Decretos Legislativos valen todo el odio y dolor que generarán estas muertes. Se podrá ahora hablar de una solución pacifica y concertada con tantas muertes a cuestas (sobre todo cuando ya la Ministra del Interior ha declarado que Pizango y compañía deben ser detenidos y puestos a disposición de las autoridades – RPP 16:30) Lamentablemente comenzará la casería por encontrar a los responsables “políticos” e “ideológicos” de esta masacre; qué actitud que tomará el parlamento respecto a los decretos aún es incierto (seguramente estarán pensando más en la censura ministerial que en otra cosa); lo único claro es que el tema de fondo que en algún momento pudo discutirse “el modelo de desarrollo amazónico” solo sabe Dios cuando volverá al debate público.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"translation\">Now I wonder if a few legislative decrees are worth all the hatred and pain that have caused these deaths. We could now talk about a peaceful and agreed upon resolution at the cost of so many deaths (especially when the Minister of Interior has stated that (indigenous protest leader) Pizango and others should be arrested and brought to the authorities - 16:30 RPP) Unfortunately, the hunt will begin to find those &#8220;political&#8221; and &#8220;ideological&#8221; individuals responsible for the massacre; what position will the parliament take on the decrees is still unclear (surely they are thinking more about ministerial censure, than anything else), the only thing clear is that main issue that could have been discussed &#8220;the model for Amazon development&#8221; only God knows when it can return to public debate.</div>\n<p>Peruvian ex-pat in Spain, Jomra <a href=\"http://bitacora.jomra.es/2009/06/peru/alan-garcia-miente-selva/\">unequivocally criticizes President García [es]</a>, who <a href=\"http://www.peru.com/noticias/portada20090605/37781/Presidente-Alan-Garcia-advierte-a-nativos-Ya-esta-bueno-de-protestas\">said [es]</a> that the protesters were wrong and that they cannot tell 28 million of Peruvians that they are not welcome in that region and by doing so they are stepping into irrationality and &#8220;primitive retreat.&#8221;  Jomra writes about García:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No solo es mentiroso, sino que es intolerante e ignorante de la propia Constitución y los tratados que Perú ha firmado. &#8230; Pero lo importante es el fondo: El presidente asume que puede aplastar lo que la Constitución y el Convenio OIT nº 169 Sobre Pueblos Indígenas y Tribales en Países Independientes (de 1989, entró en vigor en el 91 y Perú lo ratificó en el 94), en la primera se establece una entidad jurídica especial para las Comunidades nativas y campesinas que el ejecutivo debe respetar y en el segundo se obliga a que toda decisión que afecte a las comunidades sea previamente consultada. El DL 1090 no lo ha sido.</p>\n<p>García cada vez que puede acusa a la dirigencia de las comunidades de manipular a los pobres ignorantes, a la vez que pone que todo esto está orquestado por otros países, no se atreve a acusar a Venezuela pero indica que a quien conviene es a Chile (supongo que en el vecino del sur se mueren de risa al oír los despropósitos de García).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"translation\">\n<p>Not only is he a liar, but he is intolerant and ignorant of the Constitution and treaties which Peru has signed. &#8230; But the most important thing is: The president assumes that he can discard what is outlined by the Constitution and ILO Agreement No. 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries (1989, entered into effect in 1991 and ratified by Peru in 1994). The first establishes a special legal entity for the indigenous and peasant communities and farmers, and that the executive branch must respect this entity. The second requires that any decision affecting the community must be in consultation. Decree 1090 was not in consultation.</p>\n<p>Whenever García can accuse the community leaders of manipulating the poor and ignorant, he does. At the same time, he says that this is orchestrated by other countries, he does not dare to accuse Venezuela, but he said that this benefits Chile ( I suppose that in the southern neighbor is dying of laughter when they heard this nonsense from García).</p>\n</div>\n<p>Amazilia Fracaso of <em>Perú Apartheid [es]</em> <a href=\"http://amazilia.wordpress.com/2009/06/06/fracaso-peruano/\">writes about the failure of Peruvian society</a> and one of those symptoms is that the deaths could have been avoided. She also criticizes the media for their role during this crisis:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>También lo es que la indiferencia e incluso la justificación de muchos comentaristas y bloggers, que haya gente que es capaz de aceptar estas muertes como necesarias para mantener el orden y el desarrollo significa que aún estamos muy lejos de ser un país que pueda caminar hacia adelante.</p>\n<p>Es vegonzoso como los medios de comunicación como Peru21, El Comercio, RPP, desinforman a la población y se dedican a poner a la opinión pública en contra de las protestas sociales, ya sea minimizando las muertes que los nativos han sufrido, escondiendo información o exagerando y dandole un spin tétrico a las noticias. Esto también pasa con alguna prensa internacional, Simón Romero del NYT hace una nota sobre la protesta, mezcla el conflicto con Sendero Luminoso, (y) presenta a los nativos como anti-desarrollo.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"translation\">\n<p>It is also the indifference and even the justification from many commentators and bloggers, who are people that are able to accept these deaths as necessary to maintain order and development, that means that we are still far from being a country that can move forward.</p>\n<p>It is shameful that media such as Peru21, El Comercio, RPP, misinform the public and devote themselves to sway public opinion against the social protests, either by minimizing the deaths that the natives have suffered, hiding information or by exaggerating and giving a grim spin on the news.

A citizen took action to protest against the TV news department by holding a slogan in front of the camera when the reporter was having live report.

My friend A told me that the CCTVB news department leader Yuen Chi Wai was very angry about the incident. But as my friend A said, we could not complain about the heavenly disaster but this is a man-made choice. It is so obvious even to ordinary people that Yuen Chi Wai had downplayed the release of Zhao Ziyang memoirs. On June 4, CCTVB even placed the news to the third news session.

That motion was only passed by a discussion group on railway affair of the transportation committee of the Legislative Council. It isn&#39;t any railway affair committee in the Legco, the report is misleading in the first place. The so-called committee is just a discussion group within the transportation affair committee.

AFP, on the other hand, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gmh-vG8pht1d7rLFZ0CaiagGuLNw\">reported</a> a French governmental source.

Fort de sa longévité et de la fortune amassée au sommet du Gabon, Le Hadj s’octroie le luxe de financer des campagnes électorales en France notamment celle de François Mitterrand comme l’a écrit Pierre Péan dans « Affaires africaines ». Il laisse aussi un gigantesque parc mobilier et immobilier en France et des comptes bancaires secrets qui bien évidemment font et feront le bonheur des paradis fiscaux qui les hébergent. Le peuple gabonais pendant ce temps manque de tout. Avec un tel bilan, la terre ne lui sera pas légère du tout. Et les Africains qu’il prétendait cyniquement représenter ne se mettront pas en deuil, non plus.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"translation\">Friend of all French governments since De Gaulle, Albert-Bernard Bongo, who later became El Hadj Omar Bongo and then Ondimba (the people were asking for democratic change, he offered them personal name changes), he never stopped being the French secret service agent that he had been since he came to power. With his longevity and fortune amassed in power, the Hadj afforded himself the luxury of financing electoral campaigns in France, in particular that of François Mitterrant as written by Pierre Péan in &#8220;African Affairs&#8221;. He&#39;s also leaving gigantic real estate assets and private property in France, and secret bank accounts that are making the tax havens where they are hosted very happy. Meanwhile, the Gabonese people are lacking everything. With this legacy, he will not be missed at all. And the Africans that he was cynically pretending to represent will not mourn him either.</div>\n<p>Citing Togo&#39;s experience, Kopgli doubts Bongo&#39;s death will bring change:</p>\n<blockquote><p>La mort de Bongo n’apportera rien de salutaire au peuple gabonais, car les héritiers Ali et Pascaline Bongo sont déjà positionnés et portés par Bolloré – ami personnel de Sarkozy – et de Christophe de Margerie de TotalFinaElf et de bien d’autres vampires pour capter le pouvoir, comme ce fut le cas du Togo où les fils du défunt Gnassingbe ont été portés au pouvoir sous le double poids du viol et des violences.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"translation\">Bongo&#39;s death is not going to bring anything beneficial to the Gabonese people, because the heir and heiress Ali and Pascaline Bongo have already been groomed and brought by Bolloré -personal friend of Sarkozy- and of Christophe de Margerie of TotalFinaElf and many other vampires to suck power, as it was the case in Togo where the children of the late Gnassingbe were brought to power under the double weight of rape and violence.</div>\n<p>Ivorian blogger Théophile Kouamouo [Fr], who also mentions Togo, ponders about what will happen after Bongo&#39;s death and <a href=\"http://kouamouo.ivoire-blog.com/archive/2009/06/08/omar-bongo-la-fin-d-un-dinosaure.html\">wonders about the future of the Françafrique</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Maintenant que le &#8220;patriarche&#8221; n&#39;est plus, l&#39;on entre dans l&#39;ère des incertitudes et des questionnements.

Is the Gabonese army, completely invisible, going to enter the scene?</p>\n<p>More profoundly, what is the legacy of Omar Bongo Odinma? After his death, is the Françafrique, of which he was the pillar, going to weaken? Personally, I think so - but maybe I&#39;m getting ahead of myself. This system was too focused on certain men, on little secrets, on exit rules that don&#39;t exist anymore, to last forever.

      "description" : "<p>The French airbus that vanished from radar on Sunday on its way from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Paris, France, has caused much grieving, question marks and, of course, media speculation. Air France flight number <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_447\">AF 447</a> took off from Brazil on Sunday 31th of May with 216 passengers and 12 crew members and was expected to arrive at its destination the next day.

But on some Brazilian blogs, the debate is about the media coverage of the disaster. For <em><a href=\"http://leitedecobra.blogspot.com/2009/06/voo-447.html \">Leite de Cobra</a></em> [pt], the way in which the non-arrival of the airbus and supposed disaster has been treated is outrageous:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Acho perverso isso da imprensa ficar divulgando fatos e particulares da vida das vítimas do desastre aéreo. Não têm o mínimo respeito e nem disfarçam o desejo de que a dor renda, em escala nacional, o máximo possível, até que venha a próxima catástrofe, o próximo escândalo. Ô corja!

They don’t have the least respect for the victims and they don’t even conceal their desire that the pain lasts, in national proportions, as long as possible, until the next catastrophe, the next scandal, arrives. Oh vultures! That’s why I won’t follow anything else about this case. I&#39;ve had enough!</div>\n<p>According to bloggers, the problem is that the media always wants to report something and prove it right, come what may -  creating theories and enhancing sensationalism. <em>Camerini</em>, from blog <em><a href=\"http://transbrasil.wordpress.com/2009/06/01/voo-447-pode-ter-tido-problemas-em-zona-intertropical/\">Transbrasil</a></em> [pt], states:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Os experts de plantão já estão desfilando as baboseiras nas Tvs.</p>\n<p>Falam e falam sobre o que ainda não passa de especulações, até Raios são culpados pela queda do AirBus da Air France !</p>\n<p>É prematuro qualquer indicação sobre o acidente até que as equipes consigam, primeiro localizar os destroços do avião, depois a Caixa Preta, com o Data Recorder e o Voice Recorder, mas, como dá audiência levar para a Tv um bando de especialistas natos em acidentes aéreos, o que se pode fazer!</p>\n<p>Ouvir um Chamar o avião da Air France de Boeing A 330, outro dizer que o Atlântico é o lugar mais seguro do sistema solar , depois outro que afirma categoricamente que um raio derrubou o avião!</p>\n<p>A Verdade é que ninguém sabe ainda o que aconteceu, aonde aconteceu e como aconteceu, mas muitos especialistas deveriam saber que um acidente aéreo não ocorre apenas por uma só causa, e sim por mais fatores que desencadeam um acidente</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"translation\">The round the clock experts have already been talking a lot of rubbish on TV.</p>\n<p>They have talked and talked about things that are just speculation.

But as bringing a bunch of naturally-born-specialists to TV attracts a large audience, what can be done!</p>\n<p>I have heard one of them calling the Air France aircraft a Boeing A330, another one saying that the Atlantic Ocean is the safest place in the solar system, and then, another one emphatically affirming that lightning knocked the aircraft down!</p>\n<p>The truth is that nobody knows what has happened, where it has happened and how it has happened, but many specialists should know that an air accident doesn’t happen for just one reason, but because of a series of factors which cause an accident.</p></div>\n<p>For <em><a href=\"http://shimarina.blogspot.com/2009/06/sobre-as-teorias-que-surgem-agora.html\">Eu, Você e Todo Mundo</a></em> [pt], the desperate search for specialists is also a problem:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Gente, que absurdo!</p>\n<p>Eu como jornalista fico indignada mesmooo!!!

Enfim, de acordo com o texto dela que vou colocar abaixo, essa catástrofe é efeito da conjunção de uma série de números ruins, energias negativas&#8230; pra mim é demais querer explorar uma tragédia como essa dessa maneira.

If it was a bus full of people from northeast [of Brazil], the case would have been forgotten. Thousands of people die of hunger on the African Continent.

From Kuwait, the blogger <em><a href=\"http://www.zdistrict.com/2009/06/02/air-france-447-tragedy/\">ZDistrict</a></em> summed up his feelings.</p>\n<blockquote><p>228 people from Brazil to France on an Air France flight has vanished over the Atlantic after flying into turbulence. I haven’t seen a tragedy such as this in a long time, a flight of this type crashing in the middle of the Atlantic.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.zdistrict.com/2009/06/02/air-france-447-tragedy/#comment-233389\">Charles</a></em>, a commenter on ZDistrict has this to say:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Fear, helpless, horrific moment - it brings tears and heart ache to hear anyone enduring that final moment. Really hope they were all asleep during all that moments. Its over now, their faith bring them to where they belong.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Commenter <em><a href=\"http://www.zdistrict.com/2009/06/02/air-france-447-tragedy/#comment-233367\">Another Me</a></em> states:</p>\n<blockquote><p>i’m so sad for the families. i fly frequently and can’t imagine what the passengers must have felt, not to mention the families. i also have an infant and that just breaks my heart to think of that innocent little baby, unaware of what’s happening. in my opinion, the governing international aviation athority (whoever that is) needs to restrict pilots from flying through or above thunderstorms, and require that they fly around all storms. those storms can reach upward of 50,000 ft; trying to fly above is just too risky.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Many times, air tragedies occurring over the Atlantic Ocean have been associated with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda_Triangle\">Bermuda Triangle</a>, which is located north of Brazil, between Florida (USA), Puerto Rico and Bermuda. Still from Kuwait, Twitter user <em>@<a href=\"http://twitter.com/2twentythree3/statuses/1995737255”\">2Twenty3 </a></em>suggests that the &#8220;Bermuda triangle needs investigating&#8221;.<a href=\"http://twitter.com/2twentythree3/statuses/1995737255”\"><br />\n</a></p>\n<p>Cynthia Drescher, blogging at the <em>Britannica Blog</em>, <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/blogs/2009/06/is-air-france-flight-447-lost-in-the-bermuda-triangle/”\">says</a> that the lack of information regarding the disaster will bring out conspiracy theorists, and many have alredy tried to link the crash with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda_Triangle\">Bermuda Triangle</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>…[T]he skeptics would like to heighten the drama by associating the Bermuda Triangle with this recent mystery. What’s next — asserting that the Triangle is now some sort of giant trapezoid? Perhaps the mysterious area got bored with hanging out off the US coast and decided to journey to Brazil for some caipirinhas?<br />\nAlthough authorities haven’t yet confirmed that the floating seats are indeed from the missing Air France jet, it’s pretty easy to see on the map above that for once, this possible tragedy has nothing to do with aliens or electromagnetic fields or the ghost of Amelia Earhart. It does, however, have everything to do with freak accidents and airplane safety.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Not forgetting the Bermuda Triangle effect, Polish blog <a href=\"http://tierraincognita.blox.pl/2009/06/Katastrofa-Air-France.html\"><em>Tierra Incognita</em> </a>[pl], wonders what has happened, affirming that despite the  catastrophe of the disappearance, he stills loves flying:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Uwielbiam latać samolotem</strong>. Podróż lotnicza nie wywołuje u mnie żadnego stresu, wręcz przeciwnie – działa uspokajająco i relaksująco. W chwili gdy maszyna odrywa się od ziemi wpadam w specyficzny błogostan, mam wrażenie że wszystkie moje problemy i zmartwienia pozostały tam na dole. Świadomość, że przez najbliższe kilka godzin podróży będę w zupełnie innym wymiarze, gdzie w sumie nic ode mnie nie zależy, sprawia mi wielką frajdę. Jak dziecko, godzinami mogę gapić się przez okienko, nawet jeśli to czarna noc i widać tylko gwiazdy.</p>\n<p>Zastanawiam się dlaczego ten właśnie wypadek aż tak bardzo wlazł mi pod skórę? Złożyło się na to pewnie kilka czynników – Air France jest jednym z moich ulubionych przewoźników, dosłownie kilkanaście dni temu odprowadzałem bliską przyjaciółkę na samolot lecący z Caracas do Paryża, a ja sam też na trasie Ameryka Południowa – Europa latam dość często. No i jeszcze ta tajemniczość tej katastrofy – nie żadne „tradycyjne” kłopoty przy starcie, bądź lądowaniu, ale zaginięcie gdzieś na środku oceanu. Dobrze, że przynajmniej nie nad Trójkątem Bermudzkim&#8230;</p>\n<p>Na szczęście nie sądzę aby ten wypadek zmienił mój stosunek do latania. Nadal się cieszę, że prawdopodobnie jeszcze w tym miesiącu będę musiał kilka razy wsiąść do samolotu. I wciąż mam nadzieję, że jeszcze w tym roku uda mi się dolecieć samolotem do Księżyca&#8230;</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"translation\"><strong>I love flying on air planes</strong>.  The air travel is not stressful to me at all, on the contrary - it relaxes me and calms me down. The moment the machine stops touching earth I get into a specific state of peacefulness, I have a feeling that all my problems and troubles are left below. The thought of being stuck for the next few hours in a completely different dimention where nothing really depends on me, is really cool. Like a kid, I can stare through the window for hours, even if its nighttime and all I can see is stars. I wonder why exactly this accident touched me so deeply? Probably there are a few reasons - Air France is one of my favourite companies, just a few days ago I walked my close friend for a flight from Caracas to Paris, and I myself very often travel on the line South America - Europe. And the whole  mystery surrounding this catastrophe – not the &#8216;usual&#39; problems with take off or landing, but disappearance somewhere in the middle of the ocean. Good job it didn&#39;t happen over the Bermuda Triangle&#8230; Luckily I do not think that this accident will change my attitude towards flying. I am still happy that I will most probably have to sit  on a plane a few times this month. And I hope that this month too I will be able to catch the plane to the Moon.</div>\n<p>Discussions and rumours have begun to focus not only on the strange weather patterns in the part of the Atlantic where the plane went down, but also on the computer systems on the Airbus A330-203. Specifically, some are investigating the coincidences between the Air France flight and an October 2008 Quantas flight headed for Perth, Australia that dropped 200 meters in a matter of minutes, forcing the plane to make an emergency landing. Others <a href=\"”http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/australian-airbus-incident-unlikely-to-be-relevant-to-air-france-disaster-2009-06-03“\">argue</a> this incident is not relevant to the recent disaster. From <a href=\"http://blogs.crikey.com.au/planetalking/2009/06/03/af447-mid-air-breakup-evidence-raises-new-discussions-about-the-last-signals-sent-to-paris\">Plane Talking</a>, written by Ben Sandilands  at <em>Crikey Blogs</em> in Australia.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It has been reported by The Aviation Herald, an online Europe based journal of aviation incidents and news that the main body of electronic alerts begin with the disengagement of the autopilot and were followed by messages related to the ADIRU or air data and inertial reference units and the PRIM or flight control primary computer which is informed about speed, attitude and other material flight values by the ADIRUs.<br />\nSuperficially this resembles the onset of the mid air upset that caused Qantas flight QF72 from Singapore to Perth to make an emergency landing in Learmonth last October.<br />\nThe PRIM will in some flight modes intervene in the flight controls settings of the jet to inhibit pilot inputs which would exceed critical limits which could stall the airliner, or overload parts of the structure or control surfaces on the wings or rudder.<br />\nHowever these limitations can also be in turn locked out by the pilot.<br />\nOther reports indicate that these ‘unprecedented’ messages were concentrated in a four minute period, ending with a final advisory message about the vertical speed, that is, the rate at which the jet was falling rather than any speed with which it was also moving forwards.<br />\nFaulty ADIRU units in the Qantas A330-300 operating the flight that diverted to Learmonth remain a major focus of an unfinished air accident investigation by the ATSB. That investigation is also looking at other ADIRU related incidents on Qantas A330s.<br />\nHowever the Qantas ADIRU units were made by Northrop Grumman, while those in the Air France jet were made by Honeywell, They are two completely different designs, running totally different sets of programmed logic to serve the same ends.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Most of the passengers whose lives were claimed by the crash were French: there were 61 French passengers and 11 French crewmembers. Charles-guy de Kerimel, the writer of the aviation history blog <a href=\"http://pdlaviation.unblog.fr/2009/06/02/vol-air-france-rio-paris/\"><em>Des avions et des hommes</em> expresses his condolences</a> [fr] to the passengers and the crew of the Airbus A330-203.</p>\n<blockquote><p>L’annonce de cet accident me remplit de tristesse.<br />\nLe plus grave accident d’Air France, nous dit-on.<br />\nIndépendamment du nombre de victimes, pour chacun de ceux qui sont concernés la gravité est extrême, pour la victime bien sûr, mais aussi pour les parents, les amis, les collègues : ils se trouvent brutalement confrontés à une perte irrémédiable. Je m’associe à leur peine. Je songe au personnel d’Air France ; en premier lieu aux navigants, comme leurs aînés ils vont poursuivre leur tâche.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"translation\">The announcement of this accident fills me with sadness.<br />\nThis is Air France’s most serious accident, we are told…<br />\nRegardless of the number of victims, for each of those involved it is extremely serious for the victim, but also for parents, friends, colleagues: they are suddenly faced with an irreparable loss. I feel their pain.

I don&#39;t think its because American presidents usually don&#39;t receive the Egyptian president in previous visits, but because our president is &#8220;tired&#8221; and not ready to make any physical effort.

Speech in Cairo by the jeja is here in four separate parts. Really no reason for any other leaders of the world to continue ruling their own little domains. The jeja seems to have it all under control and will be the first, self-appointed, world leader from hereon out. Oh, sure. He says everything he has aspirations for, that he thinks can be achieved in the world, will need to be done &#8220;together.&#8221; Don&#39;t believe him for one single skinny second. If his lips are moving, he is lying. Hoo Boy.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Syrian <i><a href=\"http://khaldounjarbou.wordpress.com/2009/05/22/hello-world/\">Khaldoun Jarbou</a></i> too wasn&#39;t impressed but writes: </p>\n<blockquote><p>I don’t see any thing new in Obama’s speech, more than that, anyone who kept up with his campaign he/she will notes that this speech is a collection of what he had said before in his way to the White House, but how ever I have liked his choosing of some words. I mean in that Violence and Extremist instead of Terrorism and Terrorist.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Bahraini <i><a href=\"http://mahmood.tv/2009/06/05/obama-the-time-to-deliver-is-now/\">Mahmood Al Yousif</a></i> wonders out aloud on the speech venue: </p>\n<blockquote><p>I keep asking myself why did Obama choose the most repressive regimes in the Middle East to honour not only with his presence, but also to use as a launchpad for his Utopian vision of a peaceful and democratic Middle East? A vision that will continue to remain as illusive as a desert mirage for us Middle Eastners.</p>\n<p>Then I try to select an alternate of the 22 Arab countries where he could have used instead, but I fail to find a single one which could be worthy of such an occasion.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On the speech itself, <i>Al Yousif</i> adds: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Regardless, he touched the perennial issues; Palestine through to women’s rights, freedom of expression to democratic governments and of course the rejection of terrorism and freedom of belief. Points which generally have been raised by every single American president - and world leader for that matter - albeit without such eloquence and empathy - but so far without any concrete steps to see through their resolutions. Somehow a “shared interest” creeps in and all those promises get shelved or forgotten to be revived upon a new ascension to a throne. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Writing at <i><a href=\"http://www.mideastyouth.com/2009/06/04/why-i-didnt-listen-to-obamas-speech/\">Mideast Youth</a></i>, fellow Bahraini <i>Esra&#39;a</i> explains why she did not tune into the speech: </p>\n<blockquote><p>As an Arab and a Muslim, there was nothing much I can benefit from what Obama has to say. I’m so tired of these tedious speeches and words and praises and promises that no one, including the target audience, ever lives up to. Despite not watching this speech due to lack of interest, I sat down on Twitter and was franly disgusted at the hype, the way people were mindlessly cheering his words on, as if they don’t understand the sources of our issues to begin with. Suddenly Obama was here to “fix things,” while reducing our problems to the size of a footnote.</p>\n<p>I support Obama, at least in comparison to his war-mongering colleagues. But we don’t need his leadership, or anyone else’s for that matter. </p></blockquote>\n<p>In Israel, writing at <i><a href=\"http://southjerusalem.com/2009/06/the-june-4-lines/#more-1274\">South Jerusalem</a></i> <i>Gresghom Gorenberg</i> notes how the speech has changed history: </p>\n<blockquote><p> Barack Obama likes to change what history means, and that’s a very good thing.</p>\n<p>Today, for instance, marks 42 years since the Six-Day War began. Ever since then, the term “June 4 lines” has referred to the  on-the-ground border between Israel and its Arab neighbors on the eve of the war - not the lines marked on maps, but the lines marked by forward military positions. On the Syrian front, for instance, the actual positions lined up with neither the pre-1948 international border between Palestine and Syria, nor with the 1949 armistice agreements. The small distances on the ground make for big problems in peace negotiations.</p>\n<p>As of yesterday, however, June 4 means something entirely different. It now refers to the day on which Barack Obama chose to speak in Cairo. “June 4 lines” henceforth mean the line of thinking that the president laid out for reconciliation between the U.S. and the Muslim world, and along the way, between Israel and the Palestinians.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On the speech, <i>Gorenberg</i> writes: </p>\n<blockquote><p>His message to us was very, very basic Obama: First, I acknowledge your history. Second, it’s time each of you recognize the other’s side history, that you stop thinking that somehow by admitting the other’s side suffering you’ll erase your own. And now that you’ve acknowledged history, stop holding on to it as if electricity were running through it, as if your hand can’t let go. Move forward. Turn history into history - the text explaining how we got here - and stop treating it as an ever-repeating present.</p></blockquote>\n",
